Let say there are muliple objects communication with each other for instance an 
Employee object communicate with HR, Manager and Accountant while Accountant 
communicate with HR and Manager etc. As we can observe here is that this type of
multiple object interaction creates a mesh which is difficult to handle and 
unmangeable.

To solve this problem we use Mediator Pattern in which for interaction or 
communiaction between multiple objects there is a mediator which makes the 
interaction a smooth process and results in loosely coupled system.

When to use Mediator Pattern:

if there are multiple objects which interact with each other and forms a mesh
then we must use Mediator Pattern in which its mediator responsibilty to conduct a
smooth communication between objects.
