In Chain of Responsibility (COR) pattern multiple object process on single object or input
in a sequencial manner to acchieve a common goal. Let say you want to authenticate 
a user before giving access to certain web pages and for authentication you want to 
check whether username entered is valid or not, if its valid then check password 
thereafter check captcha entered and at last check the otp entered by the user 
if everything goes well then give access to user. 

In this use case, multiple checker is processing on single input to achieve a common 
goal that is to authenticate user and if at any stage of chain user input isn't valid
the chain will break and no further process will happen.

Another usecase can be where a candidate has to be hired based on the different 
rounds it clears and will get selected after passing all the rounds. Since all the 
rounds will be in a sequence therefore we must use COR pattern here.

When to use Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

If there are multiple process that has to be done in sequencial manner for single 
input to achieve common goal that it is advisable to use Chain of Responsibility 
pattern
