Let say you want to track the state of the object as a snapshot as there is any 
change in object but to track it you have to make all the attributes of the object 
public or have to provide access to all those object using getters. 

This problem can be solved by using memento Pattern in which responsibility of 
storing the snapshots of the object is given to the object itself and to achieve 
this object has a innerclass which has all the attributes similar to outer class
and tracks the attributes of the outer class.

When to use Memento Pattern:

Memento Pattern is used when you want to track and store the snapshots of an object
and doesn't want to expose the attributes of the object.
