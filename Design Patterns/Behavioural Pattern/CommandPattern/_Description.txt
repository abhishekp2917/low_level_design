In Command pattern we encapsulate the command in a class which has two method, one for 
executing the command for which the class is created and another is for undoing or 
unexecuting that command. 

This command object is then invoked by the invoker object and since invoker and command
are separate we can pass the command at the runtime which will give more flexibility
to the application.

This pattern is mostly used in case where there is a requirement to undo any operation
or to track the opeartion so that at later stage it can be undone. For instance if we
want to make image editor in which we want to track the operation that have been done
on image in that case we can make use of command pattern. Moreover, we can use it in 
home automation system where we can assosiate commands that acts on various appliances
with invoker such as remote comtrol or voice assistance.

When to use Command Pattern:

When there are multiple consumer or methods which uses same logic, then instead of 
writing code for same logic multiple time, make that logic encapsulated into a class
so that all the methods which want to use that logic can use it.
