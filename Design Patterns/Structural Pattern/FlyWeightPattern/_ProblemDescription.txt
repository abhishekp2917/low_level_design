_______________________________________Problem_________________________________________

suppose in an application there is a requirement of creating objects hundreds of 
thousands times but some of the objects have similar attributes. So, if we create
that much amount of objects than there is a possibility that our application will
run out of memory. To slove this problem, Fly-weight pattern is used.

_____________________________________Solution___________________________________________

In Fly-weight pattern, instead of creating new objects everytime we need, we use the 
previous created objects. To achieve that, we create a factory class which stores all
the created objects in a hashtable and key of hashtable is the object attribute which
has finite value for e.g colour of shapes if we are creating multiple objects of same 
shapes.
