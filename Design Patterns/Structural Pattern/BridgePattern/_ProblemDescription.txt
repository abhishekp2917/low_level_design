_______________________________________Problem_________________________________________

Suppose we are making OTT platform like spotify in which we want to display various
resources like Albums, Books, Movies, Songs etc in various kind of views like short
summary view, long descriptive view, thumbnail view etc and there can be any 
combination possible while making platform.

So to make this OTT platform, normally we would end up making classes all the
combinations of views like Album short view, Album thumbnail view, Song long view etc
which will result in class explotion.

Let's say we have 4 types of views and 6 types of resources then if we don't use 
bridge pattern then we will end up making 4*6=24 classes which would become difficult
to handle.

Moreover, is we add one more view or resource the we will have to make all the 
combination of new resource and view. To solve this we use Bridge pattern.


_____________________________________Solution___________________________________________

In Bridge pattern, we making multiple classes of views like short view, long view etc
and to implement views of different resources one can make various individual resources
class and we will use objects to those resource class in our view class at the runtime
to show resources in different views combination.

By using bridge pattern, we only need to make 4+6 classes in this use case.
