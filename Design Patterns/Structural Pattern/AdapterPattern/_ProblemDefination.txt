_____________________________________Problem___________________________________________

Suppose there is a client that needs to generate a JSON payload using a method that works 
only with objects implementing the PayloadGenerator interface. 

However, your existing code generates payloads only in XML format through a class 
XMLPayloadAdaptee which provides a method to generate XML. The client cannot directly 
use the XML payload where JSON is expected. 

How can you integrate the existing XML generator so the client can seamlessly get JSON payloads? 

_____________________________________Solution___________________________________________

Using the Adapter pattern, we create an adapter class JSONPayloadAdapter that implements 
the PayloadGenerator interface (expected by the client). 

This adapter holds a reference to the XMLPayloadAdaptee and internally calls its XML 
generation method. 

It then converts or adapts the XML data into JSON format inside the adapter class. Since 
the adapter implements PayloadGenerator, the client can use it just like any other JSON 
payload generator, enabling reuse of the existing XML payload code without modifying the client.
