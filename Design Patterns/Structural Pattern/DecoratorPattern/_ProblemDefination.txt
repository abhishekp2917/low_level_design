_______________________________________Problem_________________________________________

Suppose there is restaurant which serves various dishes like 'Samosha', 'Dhosa',
'Mendu Vada' etc which is of type 'Dishes' and customer can order these dishes and in
addition to these dishes they can have various combinations of addons like 
'Red Chutney', 'Green Chutney', 'Sambhar', 'Coconut Chutney', 'Ketchup' etc.

Since, there are multiple combinations of dishes with addons are possible and one customer
can order one dishes with multiple and various types addons like 'Dhosa' with 
'Coconut Chutney', 'Ketchup' and 'Green Chutney' we have to make all the combinations
Dishes which will result in class explosion. Moreover, it is not scalable and manageable.

To solve this, one can use Decorator pattern. 


_____________________________________Solution___________________________________________

In Decorator pattern, we will make abstract class of Dishes and from that we will make 
concrete class of various Dishes like 'Samosha', 'Dosha' etc.

Now for addons, we will make another abstract class of 'Addons' which will be of type
'Dishes' and will use 'Dishes' type object to add own class functionality and we can use 
any number and combination of 'Addons'.
